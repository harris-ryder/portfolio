  "about": {
    "para1": "My passions lie in tinkering and playing with new tools, which led me to study Engineering at the University of Cambridge back in 2015. Since then, I've worked in various engineering roles but have naturally gravitated towards software and automation. My journey began with writing scripts to automate 3D design tasks and publishing iPhone applications in my free time.",
    "para2": "A year ago, I made the leap into web development. Since then, I've completed The Odin Project and ThreeJSJourney, and have pursued my own projects. This experience has solidified my love for creating and optimizing web applications, and I'm excited to continue exploring the vast world of full-stack development."
